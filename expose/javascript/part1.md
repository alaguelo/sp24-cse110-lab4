 1. Line 9 prints "values added: 20". This is because result is declared as a var within the scope of the operation that does the addition, so it works correctly.
 2. Line 13 won't print if the third parameter of the function is true. However, if the third parameter is false, what is printed is "final result: undefined". This is because if you get to that part, the result was never declared since it is declared inside the if block.It is however still recognized, just never with any value, so it will be undefined.
 3. Line 9 prints "values added: 20". This is because result is declared using let inside the if block, working correctly.
 4. Line 13 won't print if the third parameter of the function is true. However, if the third parameter is false, there is an error in the program. There is an error because result at that point of the program is not visible, since it is block scoped to the if part.
 5. Line 9 returns an error. This is because result is declared as a const, meaning that its value cannot be reassigned, which is what the program is trying to do within the if block.
 6. Line 13 won't print if the third parameter of the function is true. However, if the third parameter is false, there is still an error in the program. There is an error because when using const to declare result, it has the same scope as let, so it is block scoped to the if part and not recognized in the else statement.
